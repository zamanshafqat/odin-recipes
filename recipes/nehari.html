    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Nehari is a rich, aromatic Pakistani dish known for its deep flavors and slow-cooked tenderness.</strong> To prepare nehari, start by heating oil or ghee in a large pot and sautéing sliced onions
        until golden brown. Add meat—traditionally beef shank, lamb, or mutton—and cook until browned. Stir in a mixture of ginger, garlic paste, and a blend of spices including fennel seeds,
        cloves, nutmeg, black cardamom, and red chili powder for a robust flavor profile. Add flour dissolved in water to thicken the gravy. Slowly simmer the dish for several hours to tenderize 
        the meat and allow the flavors to meld. Finish with a sprinkle of garam masala, fresh coriander, green chilies, and julienned ginger. Nehari is best enjoyed hot, accompanied by naan or paratha,
        with lemon wedges on the side to enhance its rich, spicy taste.</p>
