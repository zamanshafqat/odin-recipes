    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Haleem is a hearty, slow-cooked dish popular in South Asia and the Middle East, known for its thick, creamy texture and rich flavor.</strong> 
        It is made by cooking meat, wheat, lentils, and barley together with a blend of aromatic spices. The ingredients are simmered for several hours, 
        then blended into a smooth, porridge-like consistency. Haleem is often garnished with fried onions, fresh coriander, lemon wedges, green chilies, 
        and a sprinkle of chaat masala, making it a flavorful and filling meal, traditionally served with naan or paratha.
